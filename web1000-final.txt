1-What are the four steps of mergesort?
-split array in two.
-mergesort left half.
-mergesort right half .
-join the two arrays.


2-Using JavaScript, generate a random number between 50 and 100.
Math.floor(Math.random()*50+50)+1

3-Using Javascript, generate a random number between -100 and 100.
Math.random()*-100+100+1;

4-Write a coin flip function. It should return the string "heads" half the time and the string "tails" the other half function coinFlip(){

}




function coinFlip(){

var  x = Math.random()

if(x > 0.5){
return "heads"
}
else{
return "tails"}

}

5-Re-state the following expression without using negation: !(10 > x)
(10 <= x)

6-Re-state the following expression without using negation: !(a > 10 && b <= 5)
(a < 10 || b > 5)

7-Re-state the following expression without using negation: !(!isLegal || !isFelony)
(isLegal && isFelony)

8-What is an Angular directive?
-It's a extended html whit attributes whit the prefix ng.

9-Write a function which, given a 2-d array of strings, returns the concatenation of all the strings. function twodconcat(arr){

}

function concat(){
var txt = '';
for (var i = 0; i < 100; i++){
txt =+ i + ',';
}
}

function arr(ar){
var txt = 'abc' + ar;
}

ar = [];
for (var i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
ar.push(i);

}

concat();

arr(ar);

10-Write a function which, given a 2-d array and another value x,
returns true if x is present in the two d array, and false otherwise.

var arr = [];
for(var i = 0; i < array1.length; i++){
    var found = false;
    for(var j = 0; array2.length; j++){
     if(array1[i] == array2[j]){
      found = true;
      break;
    }
   }
   if(found == false){
   arr.push(array1[i]);
  }
}



11-What is the relationship between html, the $scope construct, and angular expressions?
(Expressions are the ones that are written like so: {{quote}} ).
-The relations between html scoope and expressions are:

context where the model is stored so that controllers, directives and expressions can access it ==== scoope.
HTML with additional markup === template
access variables and functions from the scope === expressions


12-Given the following edge list, draw the graph.

E = [[1,2], [2,3], [4,5], [2,4], [1,5]  ]




13-Given the following adjacency Matrix, determine whether the graph is directed or undirected and draw it.
M = [
  [0,0,1,0,1],
  [0,0,0,0,1],
  [0,1,0,0,0],
  [0,1,0,0,0],
  [0,0,0,0,1],
]
-The graph is directed.


14-For exercises 9 and 10, if you assume that n is the size of one side of the matrix,
what is the time complexity (Big Oh) of the algorithms you wrote?
-the Big Oh is O(n).
